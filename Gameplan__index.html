    <p>As  I travel around the country watching tennis tournaments and matches, mostly junior players and club player, I cannot help but notice the <em>expressions</em> on players faces. Players often look like someone has just run over their dog. Players look misereble. They look as if they don't want to be there. Is someone making them play against their will? I like to remind players that <strong>life is short, lighten up, and have some fun.</strong> It's important that every player has a game plan before they play a match. We believe that there are at least a billion people who can benefit from learning mental/strategy sophistication, probably more.
